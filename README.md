# carto-map-from-builder-export
 Experiment creating a custom (carto.js) map given a CARTO map export. Why: this could enable us to generate a storymap GUI based on a Builder built map -- woot!

## Roadmap
- [x] get basic POC from hardcoded map
- [ ] Basic GUI for toggling on/off layers
- [ ] Basic GUI for adding/removing slides
- [ ] support importing basemap?
- [ ] Can we use the [Import API](https://carto.com/developers/import-api/reference/#tag/CARTO-Map-Visualizations) to fetch the map metadata from a GUI dropdown? Or just have user drag and drop?
