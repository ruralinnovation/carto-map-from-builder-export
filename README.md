# carto-map-from-builder-export
Custom County Preparedness ([carto.js](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/)) map using Leaflet.js to render the map.

Map logic abstracted to Map.js

## Roadmap for NewLab
- [x] get basic style/layer to match existing County Preparedness map
- [x] add API/subscription for zooming to specific regions

## Left for NewLab to handle (recommend checking out [Airship.js](https://carto.com/developers/airship/))
- [ ] Popup
- [ ] Legend
